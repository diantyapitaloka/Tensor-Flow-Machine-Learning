## ⚡💧☃️ Tensor Flow Machine Learning ☃️💧⚡ 
This dataset contains images of hand gestures from the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The images were captured as part of a hobby project where I developped a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using computer vision and machine learning on the Raspberry Pi

Here are few images taken from the dataset:
